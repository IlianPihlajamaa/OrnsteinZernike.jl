# General Workflow

In general, solving an Ornstein-Zernike equation requires the definition of following items. The linked pages describe these in more details. 

1. The interaction potential: [Interaction Potentials](@ref)
2. The system parameters: density, temperature and dimensionality: [Systems](@ref) 
3. The closure relation: [Closures](@ref)
4. The solver: [Solvers](@ref)

Once these have been defined, `solve` can be called to solve the system at hand.
